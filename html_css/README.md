## STEP 1: HTML & CSS

We start off by learning HTML & CSS, building a strong foundation in the core of web development before continuing on our journey to be a Svelte developer. CSS will most likely be fun for the most part since it's all about making things pretty. Having a strong understanding in CSS is important **before diving in to use any CSS frameworks!**
If you've never driven before, buying a sports car doesn't instantly make you a pro driver! In most cases, you actually feel more confused and might die from loss of control. (Okay, that was a slight exaggeration ðŸ˜œ)

## Notes

We will constantly incorporate both HTML & CSS to further reinforce what we have learnt. This section might get frustrating, especially when your CSS styles don't work or you can't center an element properly, but persevere and you will be rewarded! Additional efforts and practice by yourself is encouraged to grow yourself, whether in this project or in real life.
